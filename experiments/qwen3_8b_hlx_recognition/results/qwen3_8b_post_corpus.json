        "The translation of the HLX contract `{14: {@0: 42}}` to LC-R depends on the specific syntax rules of LC-R. Assuming LC-R uses a simplified nested structure with variable references, the translation might look like:\n\n**LC-R:**  \n`{14: {var0: 42}}`\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`{14: ...}`** remains as a key-value pair in LC-R.\n- **`@0`** is interpreted as a variable reference (e.g., `var0` in LC-R).\n- The structure is preserved, but the syntax is adjusted to match LC-R's conventions (e.g., using `var` for variables instead of `@`).\n\nIf LC-R uses a different notation (e.g., `14 -> var0:42`), the format would vary accordingly. Clarify the exact rules of LC-R for a precise translation.",

For example:  \n- If `@0` is a variable, it might become `$0` or `var0`.  \n- If LC-R uses a flat structure, it could be `14 -> {@0: 42}`.\n\nWithout explicit LC-R syntax rules, the above is a plausible interpretation.
